<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Special Photoinitiator for Photoresist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PI</li><li>PAG</li><li>PAC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The special photoinitiator market for photoresists is categorized into three main types: Photoinitiators (PI), Photoacid Generators (PAG), and Photobase Generators (PBG). PIs initiate polymerization upon exposure to light, making them crucial for both positive and negative photoresists. PAGs generate acids under light exposure, facilitating crosslinking in the resist material. PBGs release bases instead, neutralizing acids and enhancing resolution. Each type plays a pivotal role in optimizing the performance and functionality of photoresists in lithographic processes.</p></p>
