<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Conveyor Belt Cleaning Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Scraper</li><li>Brush</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Conveyor belt cleaning equipment is essential for maintaining efficiency and safety in industrial operations. The market can be divided into two main types: scrapers and brushes. Scrapers are designed to remove bulk material and debris from the surface of the belt, ensuring minimal spillage and contamination. Brushes, on the other hand, provide a more delicate cleaning, effectively dislodging fine particles and residues that scrapers might miss. Both types play a critical role in prolonging conveyor life and enhancing performance.</p></p>
