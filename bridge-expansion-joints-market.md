<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bridge Expansion Joints Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Joints</li><li>Closed Joints</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bridge expansion joints are essential components designed to accommodate movements in bridges due to temperature changes, traffic loads, and structural shifting. The market for these joints can be divided into two main types: open joints and closed joints. Open joints allow for free movement and drainage, effectively minimizing water accumulation and preventing corrosion. Closed joints, on the other hand, feature a sealed design that offers enhanced protection against debris and weather elements, providing a more controlled environment for structural integrity.</p></p>
